## You Might Not Need an Effect





















**Again :** If you want to use plain JS variable/array etc. inside a component, make sure that is dependent on or should have some sort of relation with state so that when component re-renders then the variable is in sync with state otherwise, it will reset its value on every render. OR we can declare it outside the component(that way it will be immune to component renders).
